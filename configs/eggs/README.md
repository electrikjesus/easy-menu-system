# Plan
I want to get something like that - note we discard help and nointeractive -:

## main menu

```
===================================================
eggs

On the road of Remastersys, Refracta, Systemback and father Knoppix!

adapt
calamares
dad
help
kill
install
produce
syncfrom
syncto
status
update
export
tools
```
After we will select one choise, we will go in a form for the command. I just create same samples: calamares, install and produce.

## calamares
```

```

## install
```
===================================================

krill TUI system installer - the egg becomes a chick

# .oclif.manifest.json

After wrote the entire mom.yaml I realized there is the opportunity of use the file .oclif.manifest.json this is automatically generated and update when I create eggs package.

# problems
I can't find a way to select the contents of command, if not by: 
```
flags=$(jq '.options.menuEntry[0].flags' eggs.json )
```
I see in manifest, they use objects inside object with a field: id, can be a solution? I don't know.

It's very interesting for me to use jq or yt, expecially thinking I can build an approch starting from manifest.yaml, but at the moment not capable to go too inside.

But if you will continue in same way, I will jump on again.
